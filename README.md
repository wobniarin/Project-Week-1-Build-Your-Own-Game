## Project Description
This is the first project developed during the Full-Time Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona. In this case, the main idea is to develop the Hangman game to play against the computer. 
The player has to guess the ice-cream flavor that has been hidden by the computer. Are you able to guess the hidden word without mistaking 6 attempts?

### Rules of the game

- The player plays against the computer
- The computer has a finite list of words to be chosen as the word to be discovered
- There's no limit of time. There's a limit on attempts: 9
- I print all the letters that have been told and are missed

## Organization
A trello board was used to develop the Hangman game. In this case, by using only one board has been enough to develop the entire workflow.
