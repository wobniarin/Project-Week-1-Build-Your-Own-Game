## Project Description
This is the first project developed during the Full-Time Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona. In this case, the main idea is to develop the Hangman game to play against the computer. 

### Rules of the game

- The player plays against the computer
- The computer has a finite list of words to be chosen as the word to be discovered
- There's no limit of time. There's a limit on attempts: 9
- I print all the letters that have been told and are missed

- Random Word Choice 
- Play the Game
- Who wins?

## Organization
A trello board was used to develop the Hangman game. In this case, by using only one board has been enough to develop the entire workflow.
